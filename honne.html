	<p>[Intro: Georgia]
		Travelling places, I ain't seen you in ages
		But I hope you come back to me
		My mind's running wild with you far away
		I still think of you a hundred times a day</p>

		<p>[Verse 1: Andy]
		I still think of you too, if only you knew
		When I'm feeling a bit down and I wanna pull through
		I look over your photograph
		And I think how much I miss you, I miss you
		I wish I knew where I was
		'Cause I don't have a clue
		I just need to work out some way of getting me to you
		'Cause I will never find a love like ours out here
		In a million years, a million years</p>

		<p>[Chorus: Andy and Georgia]
		My location unknown
		Tryna find a way back home to you again
		I gotta get back to you
		Gotta, gotta, get back to you
		My location unknown
		Tryna find a way back home to you again
		I gotta get back to you
		Gotta, gotta, get back to you</p>

		<p>[Post-Chorus: Andy and Georgia]
		I just need to know that you're safe
		Given that I'm miles away
		On the first flight, back to your side
		I don't care how long it takes
		I know you'll be worth the wait
		On the first flight, back to your side</p>

		<p>[Bridge: Georgia]
		Travelling places, I ain't seen you in ages
		But I hope you come back to me
		My mind's running wild with you far away
		I still think of you a hundred times a day</p>

		<p>[Verse 2: Andy]
		I still think of you too, if only you knew
		I just need to work out some way of getting me to you
		'Cause I will never find a love like ours out here
		In a million years, a million years</p>

		<p>[Chorus: Andy and Georgia]
		My location unknown
		Tryna find a way back home to you again
		I gotta get back to you
		Gotta, gotta, get back to you
		My location unknown
		Tryna find a way back home to you again
		I gotta get back to you
		Gotta, gotta, get back to you</p>

		<p>[Post-Chorus: Andy and Georgia]
		I just need to know that you're safe
		Given that I'm miles away
		On the first flight, back to your side
		I don't care how long it takes
		I know you'll be worth the wait
		On the first flight, back to your side</p>

		<p>[Bridge: Andy]
		I don't want to be wasting time, without you
		Don't want to throw away my life, I need you
		Something tells me we'll be alright (yeah)
		Something tells me we'll be alright, alright
		I don't want to be wasting time, without you
		Don't want to throw away my life, I need you
		Something tells me we’ll be alright
		Something tells me we’ll be alright, alright</p>

		<p>[Chorus: Andy]
		My location unknown
		Tryna find a way back home to you again
		I gotta get back to you
		Gotta, gotta, get back to you
		My location unknown
		Tryna find a way back home to you again
		I gotta get back to you
		Gotta, gotta, get back to you</p>

		<p>[Post-Chorus: Andy and Georgia]
		I just need to know that you're safe
		Given that I'm miles away
		On the first flight, back to your side
		I don't care how long it takes
		I know you'll be worth the wait
		On the first flight, back to your side</p>

		<p>[Outro: Andy]
		My location unknown
		My location unknown
		My location unknown
		My location unknown, unknown</p>
