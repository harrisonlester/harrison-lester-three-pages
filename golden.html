	<p>[Intro]
		Hey!

		[Verse 1]
		Golden, golden, golden as I open my eyes
		Hold it, focus, hoping, take me back to the light
		I know you were way too bright for me
		I'm hopeless, broken, so you wait for me in the sky
		Brown my skin just right
		You're so golden

		[Chorus]
		You're so golden
		I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared
		Because hearts get broken

		[Verse 2]
		I don't wanna be alone
		I don't wanna be alone when it ends
		Don't wanna let you know
		I don't wanna be alone
		But I can feel it take a hold (I can feel it take a hold)
		I can feel you take control (I can feel you take control)
		Of who I am, and all I've ever known
		Lovin' you's the antidote
		Golden
		[Chorus]
		You're so golden
		I don't wanna be alone
		You're so golden
		You're so golden
		I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared
		Because hearts get broken

		[Bridge]
		(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
		(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
		(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
		(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
		(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
		(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
		(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
		I know that you're scared because I'm so open

		[Chorus]
		You're so golden
		I don't wanna be alone
		You're so golden
		You're so golden
		You're so golden
		I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared
		Because hearts get broken</p>
